                <p>
                    On January 2nd of 2021 Daniella was called and confirmed to start a prayer gathering. The prayer gathering was to invite all to encounter the power of God to heal, give them hope, to help them recover and allow God to restore them after such a hard year filled with death and disease (the pandemic).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After a few months of prayer on Saturdays the people were asking for more worship and more teaching. People where driving from across the state to be apart of the prayer gatherings and still are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Daniella made the careful decision to answer the call to build the Kingdom of God and expand Safe Haven's borders from local to global by going virtual.

                <p>
                    Atarah means crown in Hebrew. The Atarah is a part of the Hebrew Tallit or known to Christians as the Prayer Shawl. The significance of the Atarah on the Tallit is that it is a reminder that we are blessed by God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the Rabbis, the reason the Atarah was put on the Tallit is to beautify the head. The Tallit is worn as a covering on the head and the head is known in the Hebrew culture as the most "esteemed" part of the body. <br><br> Many Rabbi's both current and past see the Atarah as an option you can use to beautify the Tallit with it on the collar or not.
